        <p>
        Take A Break is an annual music and arts festival designed from the ground up to reverse the often self-destructive, all-work-and-no-play attitude encouraged at the Rhode Island School of Design. Over the course of 3 years, my team converted apathetic students into engaged ones. We created professional opportunities for artists and designers to refine their craft and provided much needed avenues for learning practical leadership skills. We distributed portions of event proceeds to local and global charities.
        <p>
        <b>I am the founder and former creative director of Take A Break.</b> I built and managed a team of 45 individuals, directed meetings twice a week and mediated disagreements enthusiastically. I gave successful presentations that secured investments from on and off-campus organizations. I directed multifaceted marketing and installation campaigns and efficiently managed $60,000 dollars over 3 years - coming in under budget.

            "We took on a skeptical market and convinced them that our product promoted a more desirable lifestyle. We gained many advocates and altered the prevailing culture."
            </h4>
        </div>

        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>
        At RISD, the glorification of 'all work and no play' promotes unhealthy practices that actually hinder creativity and happiness rather than promote it. Students measure their efforts by the hours they spend working and the amount of sleep they lost in the process rather than by the quality of their investigations. 
        </p>
        <p>     
        It has led to a culture of non-participation with anemic opportunities for public engagement, relaxation and extra-curricular activities - all of which, promote more better creative insights and practical skills for professional success.
        </p>


        <h1>The Solution</h1>

        <p>
        1. An event that combines music and art in unique ways to peel students away from their work-driven seclusions at times of high stress (i.e. during finals). 
        </p>
 
        <p>
        2.An organization that works against the glorification of unhealthy work habits by organizing events, commissioning students for installation and branding work and creating opportunities for developing leadership skills.
        </p>

        Building a team
        </h1>
        
        <p>
        From the beginning, I knew that if my vision were to have the impact I wanted and the process to be exciting that I had to build a team. There were many struggles along the way that taught me how to make a team strong. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        1. Honestly assess what you and those around you need but are bad at and whenever possible, appoint people who are better than you to do them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        2. Invest in enthusiasm; even when you are unsure of the idea behind it. Doing so uncovers hidden assumptions you have been making and further commits your team to you. Those who work because they are excited often perform better than those who work for money or just experience.       
        </p>
        
        <p>
        3. Weed out weak players. When someones strength turns out to be weak - remove them completely. A weak player brings the entire team down.

        <h1>Gaining investment / Making the pitch</h1>
        <p>
        Creating Take A Break from scratch posed many financial challenges. Fortunately, being apart of a university, we were able to acquire our initial investment from them (despite serious resistance.) We gained additional sponsors to cover the rest. The process required many presentations, some around a table, others over the phone, another in front of an audience. Below are excerpts from two of the presentations we pitched for funding.

        <h1>Managing creativity (on time and under budget)</h1>

        <p>
        The first year was at best a successful disaster. Our target demographic turned out and had a good time but almost nothing went as planned. I was determined it wouldn't happen again. So, I implemented the software Project Pier and Basecamp to communicate and allocate objectives to my team. Shortly thereafter, I dug into Merlin - producing gantt charts and monitoring resource utilization so that no task was missed.

        <h1>Directing a unique brand and diverse marketing strategies</h1>

        <p>
        A particularly exciting challenge with Take a Break has been crafting a visual identity that stands out, represents our ethos and also resonates with our market. Every year, we brought on a Graphic Designer with a unique perspective to develop a seasonal aesthetic, experimental marketing proposal and brand vision. Our position at an art school, as a small organization, allowed our designers to experiment freely with their approaches - taking risks that would likely be discouraged in more conservative marketplaces.

We asked <a href="http://www.calvinwaterman.com/">Calvin Waterman</a> to do the material for us and we are glad we did. His work would serve as the foundation for future events.

        <p>
        At the second Take A Break (2011) we brought on <a href="http://ja.ckjennin.gs/">Jack Jennings</a> as our designer. An important and lacking component from the previous year was a promotional website. We wanted to include promotional offers and also engage users with the brand long before the event. As a competent web developer, <a href="http://ja.ckjennin.gs/">Jack</a> proposed that we employ a gamified promotion via the website.
        </p>
 
        <p>
        Users visit the website and the visuals are generated based on a series of rules and randomizations. Every visitor sees something different. The user holds the button down and the user with the best time, adds their name to the leader board. The highest score on the day of the concert gets free tickets.

History of Take a Break
-->

        <h1>Resurrecting the dead - a brief history</h1>

        <p>
        When Justin (cofounder) and I came together around Take A Break. We saw a culture that was very good at being unhappy - working too hard and producing lower quality work as a result. We started Take A Break because we felt inspired to create a positive and long lasting impact on the university. We did it because the challenges of building a team and executing our vision was scary enough that it seemed worthwhile. We planned it to be on Nickerson Green and it would be called Nickersonic.

        As we begun the organizing. Alumni reached out to us to tell us about Take a Break weekend that started in the 1940s and died in the late 80s. It consisted of a few events (one of which was Co-Lab) and was devoted to collaboration, music & fun. Needless to say we named our event after it. Below are various videos and images we have collected from the good ol' days.
