******** NOTES ********

Known issues:

* Hover for .windows is in the index.html - Should be integrated in the CSS.

* Project page URL's are sloppy.
* Images take up a good chunk of memory.


Brainstorm for expansion:

* Include news or blogging component
* Add thesis work and integrate it as a blog.
* Develop media queries.
* Integrate into a GUI like Tumblr.
* Develop more sophisticated navigation.
